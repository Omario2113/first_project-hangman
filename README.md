# Project 1: Hangman

This will be my first solo project; a *simple*
game to solidify my fundamentals in Python and
become more proficient with GitHub's workflow.

Project Details:
- Game can be played multiple times in a row
- Denies invalid inputs for words/letters

Future Upgrades:
- Displaying the hangman being assembled as the
players guess
